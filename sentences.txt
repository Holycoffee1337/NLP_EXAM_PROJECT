While Omar Marmoush has been a relatively successful goalscorer in the German Bundesliga for a few seasons, he has had to patiently wait for his big break before being announced as Manchester City' s third January signing on Thursday after a prolific start to the season.
He had loan spells at St Pauli and Stuttgart, only displaying his abilities in spurts but never over the course of a full season.
A team-mate of Liverpool's Mohamed Salah for his country, Marmoush has become one of the breakout stars in Europe this season with 20 goals in 26 games for Frankfurt - 15 in the Bundesliga.
Italian club AC Milan have agreed a deal to sign Manchester City captain Kyle Walker on loan for the remainder of the season. 
AC Milan have also been linked with Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford but registration rules in Italy mean they are only able to sign one player from the UK during the current transfer window.
The full-back last featured for City against West Ham on 4 January, after which he told manager Pep Guardiola he wanted to explore his options around a potential move abroad.
The moment Amad Diallo appeared at Ross County's back post to score five minutes into his debut for Rangers in January 2022, some of the 19-year-old's new team-mates looked at each other with a sense of excitement and anticipation.
"Watching him in training, he reminded me a bit of James Maddison, who I'd played with at Aberdeen," says Ryan Jack, the former Rangers and Dons man. 
The intensity was too much and Diallo faded away. Arfield, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Aribo and Scott Wright were all given time in his position. He got five minutes against Heart of Midlothian and 17 minutes against Dundee United.
Manchester City are in major danger of elimination after Wednesday's collapse at Paris St-Germain, while Liverpool are through, Arsenal are almost there and Aston Villa and Celtic - who meet - are somewhere in between.
Marcus Rashford accepts he may have to stay at Manchester United for the rest of the season after failing to secure a move in the first three and a half weeks of the transfer window.
Rashford decided against a permanent transfer to Saudi Arabia, where several clubs were interested, and other options have been explored.
A loan to Milan proved unworkable because they are signing Kyle Walker from Manchester City until the end of the season.
With 27 Bundesliga goals and 15 assists across 1½ seasons at Eintracht, plus a handful more of each in Europe, the forward reveled in the spotlight and leads the league for goal contributions this season, outpacing megastars such as Bayern Munich's Harry Kane and Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.
There have been times where City have simply looked a bit old and a bit slow, and that bears out in another statistic: Their successful take-on rate per 90 minutes is 48.4%, again the lowest of the Guardiola era.
The Lens scout who travelled to the Under-20 Asian Cup in Uzbekistan in March 2023 went with one mission: to confirm the talent of 19-year-old Uzbekistan centre-back Abdukodir Khusanov.
The club had a three-year plan to make Khusanov into one of the best centre-backs in France, but it took only 18 months.
After missing out on €40m in transfer fees last summer when exits for Kevin Danso and Neil El Aynaoui collapsed, Lens needed to bring in funds to balance their books this January.
One of the world's top agents, Jorge Mendes, brokered the transfer and Manchester City moved quickly this month to bolster their ailing defence.
Plymouth Argyle forward Morgan Whittaker missed his side's 5-0 Championship loss to touted transfer destination Burnley as he "did not show up" in time for the game.
Whittaker, who scored Argyle's winning goal in the FA Cup third-round tie at Brentford this month, was spotted in the stands during the game.
Heather O'Reilly had scored the game's final goal, dragging world number ones and two-time champions United States to a 2-2 draw in their opening match at the 2007 Women's World Cup.
Celtic clinched Champions League knockout football for the first time in 12 years after Loris Benito's late own goal secured a dramatic victory over Young Boys on a nerve-shredding night in Glasgow.
That sparked frenzied celebrations in the stands after an incredible first half of frustration. Kyogo had strayed offside for his first disallowed goal, while the second was ruled out after a foul by Callum McGregor in the build-up
Kylian Mbappe scored twice as Real Madrid came from behind to beat Las Palmas and go top of La Liga.
Real had three goals ruled out for offside, including what would have been a hat-trick goal for Mbappe while England midfielder Jude Bellingham missed a host of chances.
Real Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe says a "mentality issue" prevented him from finding his best form earlier this season.
That run included penalty misses against Liverpool in the Champions League and Athletic Bilbao in La Liga, with Madrid losing both matches. 
Hayes, 29, spent four and a half years in Scotland where she won one Scottish league title, two Scottish Cups and one League Cup.
She becomes the Seagulls' first signing of the January window, having played 26 times for Celtic this season in all competitions.
Wales midfielder Hayley Ladd has not found things easy this season, but a January move from Manchester United to Everton could be just what she needed.
She had been a key player under manager Marc Skinner but began to be overlooked following the summer arrival of Dominique Janssen.
During her time at United, Ladd played in front of a vocal fan base at Leigh Sports Village. 
It is a new era at Everton under the ownership of the Freidkin Group and Ladd is one of five players to join this month as Sorensen adds more depth.
Teenage forward Lily Murphy starred as Manchester City defeated Manchester United 2-1 to reach the semi-finals of the Women's League Cup.
There were big wins for holders Arsenal and last season's finalists Chelsea, who beat Brighton 4-0 and Durham 5-0 respectively.
City's 18-year-old forward Murphy scored and assisted in the first half at Leigh Sports Village, either side of a Millie Turner strike, as City avenged Sunday's 4-2 Women's Super League defeat by United.
The introduction of Elisabeth Terland early in the second half injected fresh impetus into United's attacks, but the Norwegian striker volleyed wide when gifted a chance to equalise.
The holders were frustrated for 65 minutes by Brighton's determined defensive performance before substitute Mariona Caldentey changed the game, pouncing on a loose pass from goalkeeper Melina Loeck to set up Frida Maanum's opener.
Another Brighton error allowed Katie McCabe to double Arsenal's lead three minutes later before Caldentey turned provider once again, teeing up Kyra Cooney-Cross, who curled home a rocket from outside the box.
Durham, the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, held their own for the first 45 minutes and went into the break only 1-0 down, having conceded to an Aggie Beever-Jones header.
Spurs took the lead through Martha Thomas, who guided her header expertly past Eleanor Heeps on 10 minutes. Despite their early dominance, however, Tottenham conceded from West Ham's first shot on target through Seraina Piubel.
Kirsty Smith's free-kick on the stroke of half-time won it for the Hammers as her long-range ball evaded everyone in the penalty area and found a way inside the post.
Arsenal took the lead in the second minute when Gabriel Martinelli's cross was cushioned into Declan Rice's path by Kai Havertz and the England midfielder hammered the ball past Zagreb keeper Ivan Nevistic.
The Gunners could have scored more - Rice had a shot blocked after a clever Odegaard pass while centre-back Gabriel headed wide from the edge of the six-yard-box from a corner.
Paris St-Germain forward Randal Kolo Muani has joined Juventus on loan until the end of the season.
Kolo Muani grew up in the outskirts of Paris and began his career at Nantes before moving to Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt.
Turkish side Fenerbahce have signed centre-back Diego Carlos from Aston Villa for an undisclosed fee. 
Real Madrid gave their ambitions to defend their Champions League title a huge boost with a comfortable win to eliminate Red Bull Salzburg.
After losing three of their opening six games, Madrid looked more like their usual selves as they dispatched the Austrians with a first-half double from Rodrygo, before a goal from Kylian Mbappe and two from Vinicius Jr - taking his tally to 101 for the club - followed after the break.
Vinicius, who moved to seven goals in six Champions League games, made it 4-0 after 55 minutes, collecting a brilliant Luka Modric pass and cutting into the box from the left before curling a right-footed effort beyond Blaswich.
Rodrygo, often less heralded than Vinicius and Mbappe, continues to be a reliable source of quality and important goals.
Meanwhile, Mbappe, who is finally starting to meet expectations after a poor start in Madrid, became only the eighth player to register 75 Champions League goal involvements.
Leon Goretzka scored twice as Bayern Munich held on against Wolfsburg to go seven points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table. 
But Michael Olise, a £45m signing from Crystal Palace last summer, put Bayern back in front six minutes before the break with his 10th goal of the season when Wolfsburg goalkeeper Kamil Grabara spilled the France international's long-range effort. 
Bayern did go 3-1 up in the 62nd minute when Goretzka struck his second of the afternoon just after the hour mark, heading Olise's free-kick into the bottom corner.

Federico Valverde is a certain starter for Real Madrid, while there will once again be a spot through the middle for Kylian Mbappe, who missed a penalty on his last Champions League appearance against Liverpool.

Crystal Palace vs. Manchester City: Head-to-head record and past meetings
Crystal Palace and Manchester City have faced each other a total of 72 times across all competitions, with the Citizens leading the overall head-to-head record having posted 38 wins to the Eagles' 17, while there have also been 17 draws played out between the two clubs.
